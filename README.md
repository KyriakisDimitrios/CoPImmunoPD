Scripts for analyzing the single cell data of the CoPImmunoPD project

<!-- ### Project Overview
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second-most common neurodegenerative disease.
Brain neuroinflammation plays a role in PD pathogenesis. However, the involvement
of peripheral immunity has not been systematically investigated. Here we analyzed &gt;700 combinatorial immunological features in fresh blood of 28 early-to-mid-stage
PD patients and 24 matched controls. We found an enhanced cytotoxic immune
profile, especially in female idiopathic PD patients (iPD), with a higher frequency of
terminally-differentiated effector memory CD8 T cells (TEMRA) and late-
differentiated CD8 + natural killer T cells. This profile was intensified by elevated
serum granzyme A and reduced percentages of CD8 + FOXP3 + regulatory T cells. The
frequency of CD8 TEMRA was negatively correlated with disease duration,
suggesting a contribution to PD pathogenesis. The enhanced portion of CD8
TEMRA and the heightened ratios between CD8 TEMRA and central-memory cells
(TCM) were further confirmed in independent cohort samples. Joint expression
between cytotoxic molecules was strengthened within CD8 TEMRA and effector-
memory T-cells (TEM). Our single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis demonstrated
accelerated differentiation within CD8 compartments, enhanced cytotoxic pathways
in CD8 TEMRA and TEM while already more-active and transcriptionally-
reprogrammed CD8 TCM and naïve cells. Our work provides a comprehensive map
on disturbed peripheral immunity in early-to-mid iPD, proposing candidates for
early diagnosis and treatments. -->
